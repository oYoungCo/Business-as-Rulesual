## 📖 Abstract

Extracting structured procedural knowledge from unstructured business documents is a critical bottleneck in process automation. Prior work has largely focused on extracting linear action flows, often overlooking the complex logical structures—such as **conditional branching** and **parallel execution**—pervasive in real-world regulatory documents.

To bridge this **"Logic Gap,"** we introduce:

1.  **BREX (Business Rule EXtraction Benchmark):** A carefully curated dataset comprising **409** real-world business documents and **2,855** expert-annotated rules spanning over 30 vertical domains.
2.  **ExIde (Executable-grounded Idealization):** A structure-aware reasoning framework that bridges natural language regulations and executable rule flows using **pseudo-code generation** as an inductive bias.

Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that executable grounding significantly outperforms standard prompting, and reasoning-optimized models demonstrate a distinct advantage in tracing long-range dependencies.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Real-world Complexity:** Covers Scientific, Industrial, Administrative, and Financial regulations, not just simple instructional texts.
* **Structured Annotation:** Rules are annotated as `(Condition, Action)` pairs with explicit **Sequential**, **Conditional**, and **Parallel** dependencies.
* **ExIde Framework:** A decompose-and-reason strategy leveraging intermediate executable representations.

## 📂 Dataset: [BREX](dataset/BREX.jsonl)

The [BREX](dataset/BREX.jsonl) dataset focuses on **Business Rule Flow Modeling**. Unlike previous datasets, it explicitly annotates the logic that governs *when* actions occur.

| Metric | Count |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Documents** | 409 |
| **Atomic Rules** | 2,855 |
| **Domains** | 30+ (Finance, Law, Admin, etc.) |
| **Dependency Types** | Sequential, Conditional, Parallel |
| **Inter-Annotator Agreement** | Kappa: 0.911 (Excellent) |

### Data Format
The dataset is provided in `.jsonl` format, where each line represents a distinct business scenario.

| Field (Original) | Field (English) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `领域` | Domain | The vertical domain of the business process (e.g., Healthcare, Finance). |
| `意图` | Intent | The specific business intent or scenario (e.g., "Medical Checkup Appointment"). |
| `文本` | Text | The unstructured raw business document. |
| `业务规则二元组` | Rule Pairs | Atomic business rules formatted as `<Condition, Action>`. |
| `依赖关系` | Dependencies | Logical dependencies between rules (Sequential, Conditional, Parallel). |

## 🚀 Methodology: ExIde Framework

ExIde adopts a two-stage strategy to recover the rule flow graph $G=(V, E)$:

### Stage I: Structure-Aware Rule Extraction
We employ **Executable Grounding (Prompt 5)**. The model first translates the text into an intermediate pseudo-code representation (using primitives like `select_from`,  `execute_action`) before extracting structured rules. This encourages early resolution of nested logic.

### Stage II: Dependency Graph Reconstruction
We treat dependency identification as a pairwise classification problem to identify **Sequential**, **Conditional**, and **Parallel** relationships, constructing a global dependency graph.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Usage

```bash
conda create -n brex python=3.10
conda activate brex
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Configuration
To run the LLM-based extraction, you need to configure your API key. We use a .env file to manage sensitive credentials securely.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

Add your API Key (e.g., Alibaba DashScope/DeepSeek) as follows:

```
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-your_api_key_here
```
### 3. Running the Extraction
#### Step 1: Business Rule Extraction
This script reads the raw business documents (prompts) and extracts atomic business rules (Conditions & Actions).

**Input**： `./business_rules.xlsx`

```bash
python business_rules_extraction.py
```
**Output**: Generates a `business_rules_results.xlsx` containing the extracted rule pairs.

#### Step 2: Dependency Identification
This script analyzes the extracted rules to identify logical relationships (Sequential, Conditional, Parallel).

**Input**：`./results.xlsx`

```bash
python dependency_extraction.py
```
**Output**: Generates a `dependency_results.xlsx`.
